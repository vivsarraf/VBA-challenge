# VBA-challenge

## Background
In this homework assignment, we will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

## Instructions
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

 * The ticker symbol.

 * Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

 * The percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

 * The total stock volume of the stock.

The result should look as follows.

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.
Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet.

## Getting Started
Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge. 
Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.
